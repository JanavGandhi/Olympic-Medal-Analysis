# Olympic-Medal-Analysis

Created a end-to-end machine learning project using Python and Jupyter where we try to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.

Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results

Basically we concluded that this model works well for countries which have a high medal count, and compete in a stable number of events annually. But its not as accurate for the countries who have a low medal count.
